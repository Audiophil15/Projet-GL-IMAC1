# Window :
	The window can be resized, it keeps the same ratio. The window coordinates can be mapped to the GL viewport coordinates, resizing the window doesn't break it.

# Rectangles :
	Methods of getX/Y and getHeight/Width moved from Block to Rectangle to generalize the behaviour.

# Blocks :
	Collision test added, works great.
